We started the first day getting to know thesyllabus and a discussion on medium as a platform for design and the different way it can be used 
We got an introduction to p5.js in the p5.js editor, in the editor we learned to setup the canvas,make the background change color
Introduced to first set of codes, getting hang of the codes took a little getting used to for a complte beginner  
We progressed to elementary shapes like rectangles, ellipses and squares and i made my first emoji on p5.js
Assignment 1: The assignment was to make a or depict an emotion with the help of just basic shapes
              the emotion were assigned randomly and i got the emotion of disgust
              i tried to play with rectangles but felt that i need to make something that feels a bit uneasy
              to i make polygons with random shapes which look very irregular and overlapped it with several other polygons, triangles and circles
              to make an abstract unsymmertical face, and filled it with very dull and mismatched which further gave it a distastefull look
              i increased its strokeweight to make it clearer
