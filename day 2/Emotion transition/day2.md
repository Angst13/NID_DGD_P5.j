i set up my github and was introduced to visual studios for further coding , i felt that visual studio was significantly more complex than the p5.js editor, learned to code funtions and variables
assignment 2: to add interaction to the previous emotion and change it to another emotion
             description
             the emotion to which the changes was going to occur was also randomly assigned in the class
             i was assigned love

             objectives
             to slowly transition from one emotion to another with breaking up or altering the images
             process
             experimentation: i tried to play around with various functions and make the eye animated
                              i tried using tranform and lerp which was getting a little too commplicated for me 
                              and after several brainstorming and going through the internet i found out that i can assign variables at eachcordinate of the shapes and then move them 
             making: althougha bit tedious, assigning each vertex or shape as a variable and assigning the quadrilaterals with that variable 
                     in the draw function
                     hence it was possible to move the quadrilaterals and triangles and then i use the lerp function to change the color slowly to a more suiting pink color, finally i used lerp again to make a quadrilateral slowly emerge from the center which looked like a smile
