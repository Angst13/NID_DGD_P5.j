we went through some generative art which makes an image from combing 4 images randomly
learned looping (nested loops), conditionals (if and else if) random function
assignment 3: to create a generative pattern using 4 images 
objective: to create a interconnected random art using the drawing
process:for that after creating setup , we creata for lopp and nested loop after that we create a random choice and an if condition 
        and make four argument for the if and one for else 
Pattern: to make the pattern, i did overlapping rectangles, triangles, squares and coincentric circles with black background and set the color to gradient with lerp, i took the help of chat gpt for the syntax and suggestions
