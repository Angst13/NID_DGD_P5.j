we recapped forloops nad learned about transformations and make a paint brush,
we learned how to add images and arrays and how to work images in arrays
Assignment: to make agenerative pattern with images and 
         arrays and make practice arrays by creating random grid and  filling it with colours from the array
objective (assignment 1) : 
        make a seemless interconnected image consisting of 4 random tiles
process: first we make an array and defint the variables 
        like size and number of the images and preload the images to select all the image files named "g",
        then i made a nested for loop and alet the choice of the images drawn to be random to make random image generate, the results were not very satisfactory as the it was not connecting very well
attempt 2: i tried to preload a more connecting image but
            this time it became quite boxy ofn all sides 
        
objective( assignment 2): 
        make a grid and colour it with arrays
process: first creat an array with hexcodes then create
         a nested loop and finally fill the colour randomly by choosing 0 to the number of hexcodes for each square grid
